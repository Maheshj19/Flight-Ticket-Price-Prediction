# Flight-Ticket-Price-Prediction
I did a project on "Flight Ticket Price Prediction". I predicted the price from dataset which I got it from #Kaggle.
In this project my Traget variable is Price. So, I imported all Python Libraries to easily predict my target variable value. 
# Missing Values 
Here, I identify missing values and I removed noise data from dataset.
# Feature Engineering and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In Machine Learning the machines can understand only numeric language. So, the features of dataset has to be converted into numbers. For this by using EDA techniques I converted all features into numeric.
# Buliding Machine Learning Models and Evaluating Them
Without dissorting feature values relative differnce we need to convert the values as common for that we need to use Normalize. Here, I used some specific models to separate the target variable and feature variables.
And to predict the Price here, I used some Machine Learning models to predict the target variable like, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Random Forest Regressor.
And finally predicted Price values with 99% Accuracy.
